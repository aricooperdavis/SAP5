To switch over to "properly made" PCBs (rather than homebrew):

Add resistor divider to UART Rx DONE
Need to add pull-up resistors to SDA and SCL DONE
Switch Peripheral LDO to MAX1624(ish) - No, we'll keep as the XC jobbie for now
Switch USB charger for MAX1555 - because known to work. Need to connect CHG pin... DONE
Keep MC78LC30 as charger, but change footprint DONE
Keep MPU9250 as is on board DONE
Need to fix capacitor on VCap - should be a 10uF cap, may need to be bigger footprint. DONE
Add low power oscillator chip SITIME 153x or something... DONE
Add a buzzer - use wired buzzer, powered off programming pins...  needs a resistor... DONE

To switch over to "properly made" PCBs (rather than homebrew):

Need to add pull-up resistors to SDA and SCL
Switch Peripheral LDO to MAX1624(ish)
Switch USB charger for MAX1555 - because known to work... hopefully.
Keep MCP1810 power supply for Vcpu
Keep MPU9250 as is on board
Need to fix capacitor on VCap - should be a 10uF cap, may need to be bigger footprint...
Add low power oscillator chip SITIME 153x or something...
Add a buzzer if space

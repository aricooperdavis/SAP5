Kit:

3v Laser rangefinder off aliexpress with serial comms
4-way conector for this...
MPU 9250
SH1106
SSD1306 display

MCP1710 power supply for PIC
PIC32MM0256GPL028 - processor
5-way connector for programming

Also a.N.other LDO to provide power for peripherals...
use CC0805KKX5R8BB475 as caps - 4.7uF 25V cap in 0805 package

MAX1555 usb lipo charger

300mAH lipo battery
JST connector

A button
Hammond enclosure as before 1953LTBU
possibly 3d printed adapter for rangefinder within enclosure
waterproof micro usb connector + dust plug

Use low power timing crystal for RTCC

Hardware Tasks:
. update footprints for JST and USB connectors
. create adaptor for oscillator
. adjust 3d printed frame for
    - shorter battery leads??
    - buzzer
    - pull pcb back from end by 0.4mm
. make 3d printed washers...
. design laser cuttung template - DONE



Firmware Tasks:
. Get proper error detection working on laser reading DONE
. Give some more generous time to get result as well?
. Get different styles of leg working (forward, backward, leapfrog)
. Get custom leg selection working
. Get visualiser working - work as "cave window", so adjust view according to angle of device
. Get set date working DONE
. Get set time working DONE
. Add some debug menu options - show uncalibrated sensor readings...
.                             - show calibrated sensor readings with magnitudes
.                             - gyro readings
.                             - battery voltage
. Change UI - start in measurement mode
            - from here a single click takes you to the main menu
            - long click anywhere takes a new readings
            - double click anywhere turns off
. fix calibration routine for accelerometer - I think just needs fitting to a sphere
. also do stop start calibration - so more accurate readings, but fewer of them.
. 1.5s to move, measure over 500ms intervals            

PC software
. note needs freetype-py and sparse_list
